	Changed the design of the dealership vehicle tab in the application. Making this change
	will make the search for a specific make, model, or year of vehicles much easier. There 
	will be a filter button implemented that will open a new WinFrame that prompts the user
	which form of filtering they wish to use: make, model or year. According to which is
	selected, a SQL/LINQ query will be run to filter the database and will display all the 
	vehicles that meet that criteria. There will also be a second button that allows the
	user to clear all filters and display the entire database in the datagridview.
